## Code details in `SRC` directory


### `Components`
Contains the reusable componets that can be used across the app. The components are loosely coupled entities and doesn't manage any state of their own. They just use the state of the app passed to demonstrate their behaviour
Each component directory has its own
    - index
    - style
    - mobile-style if mobile optimisation is needed



### `Pages`
Contains the pages that are loaded with different URL. A Page is logical combination of componets.
It has its own reducer to mange the state of the page.
Each Page directory has its own
    - index
    - style
    - mobile-style if mobile optimisation is needed
    - actionCreators
    - actionDispatchers
    - reducers
